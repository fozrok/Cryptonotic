Understanding Risk in Crypto Trading
What is Risk in Crypto Trading?
Risk in crypto trading is the possibility that your investment will lose value or that
something unexpected will happen that affects your ability to trade successfully. Unlike
traditional investments, crypto comes with unique risks that you need to understand and
prepare for.
Types of Risks You'll Encounter
1. Market Risk (Price Volatility) - What it is: The risk that crypto prices will move against
your position - Why it matters: Crypto prices can change dramatically in short
periods - How to manage: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, use stop
losses
2. Liquidity Risk - What it is: The risk that you won't be able to buy or sell when you want
to - Why it matters: Some cryptocurrencies have low trading volume - Example: Trying
to sell a small altcoin but finding no buyers - How to manage: Stick to well established
cryptocurrencies with high volume
3. Technology Risk - What it is: The risk of technical problems with exchanges, wallets,
or blockchain networks - Why it matters: Technical issues can prevent you from
accessing your crypto - Example: An exchange going down during a major price
movement - How to manage: Use reputable platforms, keep backups of important
information

4. Security Risk - What it is: The risk of losing your crypto to hackers, scams, or your own
mistakes - Why it matters: Unlike banks, there's no insurance if your crypto is stolen -
Example: Falling for a phishing scam and losing your private keys - How to manage: Use
strong security practices, enable 2FA, be skeptical of offers
5. Regulatory Risk - What it is: The risk that government regulations will negatively
impact crypto - Why it matters: New laws can affect crypto prices and accessibility -
Example: A country banning cryptocurrency trading - How to manage: Stay informed
about regulations, diversify across different cryptos
6. Emotional Risk - What it is: The risk of making poor decisions due to fear, greed, or
other emotions - Why it matters: Emotions are often the biggest enemy of successful
trading - Example: Panic selling during a market crash or FOMO buying at the top - How
to manage: Have a plan and stick to it, practice emotional discipline
The Reality of Crypto Volatility
Cryptocurrency markets are significantly more volatile than traditional stock markets.
Here's what this means for you:
Daily Price Swings: It's normal for crypto prices to move 5-20% in a single day
Weekly Fluctuations: Weekly moves of 30-50% are not uncommon
Market Cycles: Crypto goes through boom and bust cycles that can last months or years
Important: This volatility creates both opportunities and risks. The same volatility that
can make you money can also lose you money.
Risk vs. Reward
Every investment decision involves a trade-off between risk and potential reward:
Higher Risk = Higher Potential Reward: Small altcoins might give bigger returns but
are more likely to fail
Lower Risk = Lower Potential Reward: Established coins like Bitcoin are more stable but

may not multiply as quickly
Your Goal: Find the right balance for your situation, risk tolerance, and financial goals.
Risk Tolerance Assessment
Before you start trading, honestly assess your risk tolerance:
Conservative (Low Risk Tolerance): - You need this money for important expenses -
Market drops make you very anxious - You prefer steady, predictable growth -
Recommendation: Start with very small amounts, focus on established coins
Moderate (Medium Risk Tolerance): - You can afford to lose some money without major
impact - Market volatility makes you nervous but you can handle it - You want growth but
also some stability - Recommendation: Balanced approach with mostly established
coins, small allocation to riskier assets
Aggressive (High Risk Tolerance): - You can afford to lose your entire crypto investment
- Market volatility doesn't stress you significantly - You're willing to take big
risks for big rewards - Recommendation: Can explore smaller altcoins, but still need risk
management
Remember: Your risk tolerance may change over time, and that's okay. Start
conservative and adjust as you gain experience and confidence.

The Golden Rules of Risk Management
Rule #1: Never Invest More Than You Can Afford to Lose
What it means: Only use money that, if lost completely, wouldn't affect your ability to
pay bills, buy groceries, or handle emergencies.
Why it's crucial: Crypto is highly volatile and unpredictable. Even the most careful
analysis can be wrong.
How to apply it: - Pay all your bills first - Keep 3-6 months of expenses in a savings
account - Only invest "fun money" or money you've specifically set aside for high-risk
investments - If losing the money would cause you stress or financial hardship, don't
invest it
Rule #2: Start Small and Scale Gradually
What it means: Begin with tiny amounts while you learn, then gradually increase your
investment as you gain experience and confidence.
Why it's important: Learning to trade with real money is different from theory. Small
amounts let you learn without major consequences.
How to apply it: - Start with $50-100 for your first trades - Only increase your investment
after you've successfully managed smaller amounts - Think of your first investments as
"tuition" for learning - Gradually scale up as you prove to yourself that you can manage
risk
Rule #3: Diversify Your Investments
What it means: Don't put all your money into one cryptocurrency. Spread it across
different coins and even different types of investments.
Why it's essential: If one cryptocurrency fails, you won't lose everything.


--- PAGE 7 ---

How to apply it: - Within Crypto: Invest in 3-5 different cryptocurrencies - Beyond
Crypto: Keep crypto as only a small part (5-10%) of your total investments - Mix Risk
Levels: Combine established coins (Bitcoin, Ethereum) with smaller altcoins
Rule #4: Always Use Stop Losses
What it means: Set automatic sell orders that trigger if the price drops to a certain level,
limiting your losses.
Why it's vital: Emotions can prevent you from selling when you should. Stop losses
remove emotion from the equation.
How to apply it: - Set stop losses 10-20% below your purchase price for established coins
- For riskier altcoins, consider 15-25% stop losses - Adjust stop losses as prices move in
your favor - Never remove a stop loss without replacing it with a new one
Rule #5: Take Profits Regularly
What it means: Don't wait for the "perfect" exit. Take some profits as your investments
grow.
Why it's important: Markets go up and down. Taking profits ensures you benefit from
the ups.
How to apply it: - Take 25% profits when your investment doubles - Take another 25% if
it doubles again - Let the remaining amount ride for bigger potential gains - Never feel
bad about taking profits – it's the goal of investing
Rule #6: Keep Detailed Records
What it means: Track all your trades, including dates, amounts, prices, and reasons for
buying/selling.
Why it's necessary: Good records help you learn from mistakes, track performance, and
handle taxes.
How to apply it: - Use a spreadsheet or trading journal app - Record every buy and sell

transaction - Note your reasoning for each trade - Review your records monthly to
identify patterns and improvements
Rule #7: Never Trade on Emotion
What it means: Don't make trading decisions when you're feeling strong emotions like
fear, greed, excitement, or panic.
Why it's critical: Emotional decisions are usually bad decisions that lead to losses.
How to apply it: - Make your trading plan when you're calm and rational - If you feel
emotional, step away from the charts - Use predetermined rules rather than gut feelings
- Consider setting up automatic orders to remove emotion
Example: If Bitcoin crashes 30% and you feel panicked, don't immediately sell. Refer to
your plan and stop loss levels instead.
Rule #8: Educate Yourself Continuously
What it means: Never stop learning about crypto, trading, and risk management.
Why it's essential: The crypto space evolves rapidly. Continuous learning helps you
adapt and improve.
How to apply it: - Read reputable crypto news sources daily - Participate in BAE
community discussions - Attend live trading sessions - Learn from both your successes
and mistakes
Rule #9: Use Reputable Platforms Only
What it means: Only trade on well-established, regulated exchanges with good security
records.
Why it's crucial: Unregulated or sketchy platforms can steal your money or disappear
overnight.
How to apply it: - Research any platform before using it - Look for regulatory compliance
and insurance - Read user reviews and check security features - Start with well-known

exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken

Rule #10: Have an Exit Strategy
What it means: Know under what conditions you'll sell, both for profits and losses,
before you buy.
Why it's important: Having a plan prevents emotional decision-making and ensures you
stick to your risk management rules.
How to apply it: - Decide your profit targets before buying - Set your maximum
acceptable loss before buying - Write down your exit strategy and stick to it - Review and
adjust your strategy based on market conditions
Example: "I'll sell 25% if the price doubles, 25% more if it triples, and I'll exit completely if
it drops 20% from my purchase price."
Position Sizing and Capital Allocation
What is Position Sizing?
Position sizing is determining how much money to invest in each cryptocurrency trade.
It's one of the most important aspects of risk management because it directly controls
how much you can lose on any single trade.
The 1-2% Rule
The Rule: Never risk more than 1-2% of your total investment capital on a single trade.
Why it works: Even if you have 10 losing trades in a row, you'll only lose 10-20% of your
capital, leaving you plenty to recover.
How to calculate: 1. Determine your total crypto investment budget 2. Calculate 1-2% of
that amount 3. That's your maximum risk per trade


--- PAGE 11 ---

Position Sizing Formula
Step 1: Decide your entry price
Step 2: Set your stop loss level
Step 3: Calculate the difference (your risk per coin)
Step 4: Divide your maximum risk by the risk per coin
Capital Allocation Strategy
Core Holdings (60-70%): - Bitcoin and Ethereum - Most stable, established
cryptocurrencies - Lower risk, steady growth potential
Growth Holdings (20-30%): - Top 10-20 altcoins - Medium risk, higher growth potential -
Coins with strong fundamentals
Speculative Holdings (5-10%): - Smaller altcoins, new projects - High risk, high potential
reward - Money you can afford to lose completely
Example Portfolio ($1,000): - $600-700 in Bitcoin/Ethereum - $200-300 in established
altcoins - $50-100 in speculative plays


--- PAGE 12 ---

Setting Stop Losses and Take Profits
Understanding Stop Losses
A stop loss is your safety net – an automatic sell order that triggers when the price drops
to a predetermined level, limiting your losses.
How to Set Stop Losses
For Bitcoin/Ethereum: 15-20% below entry price
For Top Altcoins: 20-25% below entry price
For Speculative Coins: 25-30% below entry price
Types of Stop Losses
Fixed Stop Loss: Set at a specific price and never moved
Trailing Stop Loss: Moves up with the price but never down
Time-Based Stop: Exit after a certain time period regardless of price
Setting Take Profit Levels
Conservative Approach: - Take 25% profits at 50% gain - Take 25% profits at 100% gain -
Let remaining 50% ride
Aggressive Approach: - Take 20% profits at 100% gain - Take 30% profits at 200% gain -
Let remaining 50% ride for bigger gains
