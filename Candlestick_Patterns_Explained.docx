Understanding Candlestick Basics
What is a Candlestick?
A candlestick is a visual representation of price movement during a specific time period.
Each candlestick shows you four crucial pieces of information:
1. Opening Price: Where the price started at the beginning of the time period
2. Closing Price: Where the price ended at the end of the time period
3. Highest Price: The highest price reached during the time period
4. Lowest Price: The lowest price reached during the time period
Anatomy of a Candlestick
The Body: The thick rectangular part of the candlestick - Shows the range between
opening and closing prices - Green/White body: Closing price is higher than opening
price (bullish) - Red/Black body: Closing price is lower than opening price (bearish)
The Wicks (or Shadows): The thin lines extending from the body - Upper wick: Shows
how high the price went above the body - Lower wick: Shows how low the price went
below the body - Long wicks indicate rejection at those price levels
Reading the Story
Each candlestick tells a story about the battle between buyers and sellers:
Long Green Body: Buyers were in strong control throughout the period
Long Red Body: Sellers were in strong control throughout the period
Small Body: Neither buyers nor sellers had strong control (indecision)
Long Upper Wick: Buyers tried to push price higher but were rejected


--- PAGE 3 ---

Long Lower Wick: Sellers tried to push price lower but were rejected
Time Frames
Candlesticks can represent different time periods:
- 1-minute: Each candlestick shows 1 minute of price action
- 1-hour: Each candlestick shows 1 hour of price action
- Daily: Each candlestick shows 1 day of price action
- Weekly: Each candlestick shows 1 week of price action
For beginners: Start with daily candlesticks as they filter out short-term noise and show
clearer patterns.
Market Psychology
Understanding what candlesticks reveal about emotions:
- Fear: Creates long lower wicks as scared sellers push prices down
- Greed: Creates long upper wicks as excited
buyers push prices up
- Uncertainty: Creates small bodies as traders are unsure
- Confidence: Creates long bodies as one side dominates

Essential Single Candlestick Patterns
1. Doji
What it looks like: A candlestick with a very small body and long wicks on both sides,
resembling a cross or plus sign.
What it means: Indecision in the market. Buyers and sellers are evenly matched, and
neither side is winning the battle.
When it's important: - After a strong uptrend: May signal the uptrend is losing steam -
After a strong downtrend: May signal the downtrend is losing steam - At key support or
resistance levels: Increases significance
Trading implications: - Don't trade on a doji alone – wait for confirmation - Watch the
next few candlesticks to see which direction the market chooses - Often signals a
potential trend reversal
Beginner tip: Think of a doji as the market taking a breath and deciding what to do next.
2. Hammer
What it looks like: A candlestick with a small body at the top and a long lower wick (at
least twice the length of the body). Little to no upper wick.
What it means: After a downtrend, this shows that sellers pushed the price down, but
buyers stepped in strongly and pushed it back up.
When to look for it:
- At the end of a downtrend
- Near support levels
- After a series of red candlesticks


--- PAGE 5 ---

Trading implications:
- Bullish reversal signal
- Suggests buyers are gaining control
- Wait for confirmation with the next candlestick
Beginner tip:
The hammer "hammers out" a bottom
– it's like the market saying "we're not going any lower."
3. Shooting Star
What it looks like: A candlestick with a small body at the bottom and a long upper wick
(at least twice the length of the body). Little to no lower wick.
What it means: After an uptrend, this shows that buyers pushed the price up, but sellers
stepped in strongly and pushed it back down.
When to look for it: - At the end of an uptrend - Near resistance levels - After a series of
green candlesticks
Trading implications: - Bearish reversal signal - Suggests sellers are gaining control -
Wait for confirmation with the next candlestick
Beginner tip: The shooting star "shoots up" but falls back down – like a firework that
goes up but then comes crashing down.

4. Spinning Top
What it looks like: A candlestick with a small body (can be green or red) and long wicks
on both sides.
What it means: High volatility but indecision. The price moved significantly in both
directions but ended close to where it started.
When it's significant: - During trending markets: May signal trend exhaustion - At key
levels: Increases importance - Multiple spinning tops: Shows ongoing indecision
Trading implications: - Neutral signal – wait for direction - Often precedes significant
moves - Don't trade until you see confirmation
Beginner tip: A spinning top is like a coin flip – the market can't decide which way to go.
5. Marubozu
What it looks like: A candlestick with a long body and no wicks (or very tiny wicks).
Types:
- Bullish Marubozu: Long green body, opens at the low and closes at the high - Bearish
Marubozu: Long red body, opens at the high and closes at the low
What it means: Very strong conviction from either buyers or sellers. No indecision
whatsoever.
Trading implications: - Strong continuation signal in the direction of the body - Shows
dominant market sentiment - Often leads to further movement in the same direction
Beginner tip: Marubozu means "bald head" in Japanese – there are no wicks (hair) on
this candlestick.

Key Two-Candlestick Patterns
1. Bullish Engulfing
What it looks like: A small red candlestick followed by a larger green candlestick that
completely "engulfs" or covers the previous red one.

that they not only overcame the selling pressure but pushed the price significantly
higher.
When to look for it: - At the end of a downtrend - Near support levels - After a series of
red candlesticks
Trading implications: - Strong bullish reversal signal - Suggests a shift from bearish to
bullish sentiment - The larger the engulfing candle, the stronger the signal
Confirmation: Look for the next candlestick to continue higher to confirm the reversal.
Beginner tip: Think of it as the green candle "eating up" the red candle – buyers are
taking control.

2. Bearish Engulfing
What it looks like: A small green candlestick followed by a larger red candlestick that
completely engulfs the previous green one.
What it means: Buyers were in control initially, but sellers stepped in with such force that
they overwhelmed the buying pressure and pushed the price significantly lower.

green candlesticks
Trading implications: - Strong bearish reversal signal - Suggests a shift from bullish to
bearish sentiment - The larger the engulfing candle, the stronger the signal

3. Piercing Pattern
What it looks like: A red candlestick followed by a green candlestick that opens below
the red candle's low but closes above the midpoint of the red candle's body.
What it means: After selling pressure, buyers stepped in strongly and "pierced" through
the bearish sentiment.
When to look for it: - During downtrends - Near support levels - After significant selling
Trading implications: - Bullish reversal signal (though weaker than bullish engulfing) -

What it looks like: A green candlestick followed by a red candlestick that opens above
the green candle's high but closes below the midpoint of the green candle's body.
What it means: After buying pressure, sellers stepped in and created a "dark cloud" over
the bullish sentiment.
When to look for it: - During uptrends - Near resistance levels - After significant buying
Trading implications: - Bearish reversal signal (though weaker than bearish engulfing) -
Shows sellers are starting to gain control - Wait for confirmation
Beginner tip: The red candle creates a "dark cloud" over the green candle's optimism.
5. Harami Pattern
What it looks like: A large candlestick followed by a smaller candlestick that fits
completely within the body of the first candle.
Types:
- Bullish Harami: Large red candle followed by small green candle
- Bearish Harami: Large green candle followed by small red candle
What it means: After strong movement in one direction, the market shows indecision
and potential exhaustion.
Trading implications: - Potential reversal signal - Shows momentum is slowing - Often
followed by a change in direction

inside the larger candle.

How to Trade Candlestick Patterns
Step-by-Step Trading Process
Step 1: Identify the Pattern - Look for clear, well-formed patterns - Don't force patterns
that aren't obvious - Focus on patterns at key levels (support/resistance)
Step 2: Consider the Context - What's the overall trend? - Where is the pattern forming
(support, resistance, middle of range)? - What's the market sentiment?
Step 3: Wait for Confirmation - Don't trade immediately when you spot a pattern - Wait
for the next candlestick to confirm the signal - Look for volume confirmation (higher
volume = stronger signal)
Step 4: Plan Your Entry - Reversal patterns: Enter when confirmation candle breaks the
pattern - Continuation patterns: Enter in the direction of the trend - Use limit orders to
get better entry prices
Step 5: Set Your Stop Loss - Place stop loss beyond the pattern's key level - For bullish
patterns: Stop below the pattern's low - For bearish patterns: Stop above the pattern's
high
Step 6: Set Your Profit Target - Use support/resistance levels as targets - Consider risk-
reward ratio (aim for at least 1:2) - Take partial profits as price moves in your favor
