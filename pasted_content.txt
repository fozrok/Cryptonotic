Interactive Crypto Training Series Creation

Objective:
Convert each of the 4 attached BAE Ascend documents into separate, engaging interactive web training modules, complete with visual illustrations and consistent brand styling.

🧾 Source Materials

Use these uploaded documents as the foundation for your training content:

Risk_Management_Essentials.docx

Crypto_Trading_Terminology.docx

Candlestick_Patterns_Explained.docx

Chart_Patterns_for_Beginners.docx

🎨 Visual & Brand Guidelines

Use the branding style and color palette shown in the uploaded screenshot (272f444a-155d-43a6-96d9-7287c0728201.png) throughout the web training modules. This includes:

Primary Colors: Extract dominant brand hex values from the screenshot (e.g., purples, golds, neutrals)

Typography: Match font families and heading hierarchies shown in the UI

UI Components: Reflect the clean, modern, minimal look (e.g., cards, icon-accompanied titles, light backgrounds, curved edges)

Buttons, Checklists, and Progress Bars should align stylistically with the screenshot aesthetic.

🧠 Structure of Each Web Training Module

For each of the 4 documents, structure the interactive training document using the following format:

1. Intro Section

Title + Subtitle

Motivational welcome paragraph (tone: supportive, empowering, practical)

“What You’ll Learn” bullets (from the guide’s learning outcomes)

2. Interactive Sections per Chapter

For each chapter or major section:

Heading (consistent with the doc’s section titles)

Summary of Key Ideas (distilled into plain language)

Illustration: Generate or suggest an image to visually explain the concept (e.g., charts, metaphors, characters, diagrams)

Mini Quiz (optional): Add 1–2 simple multiple-choice or true/false questions to reinforce retention

Checklist / Key Takeaway Card (summarize the section)

3. Frameworks / Decision Tools

Where frameworks are present (e.g. stop loss rules, position sizing formulas, risk planning steps):

Rebuild as interactive calculators, drag-and-drop cards, or visual flows (use modern UI design)

4. Quick Reference Sections

Include summary tables, quick-glance guides, and visual decision trees extracted from the source material. Make this a collapsible section.

5. Practice & Application

Add interactive chart annotation exercises (for patterns/technical sections)

Include journaling prompts (especially for risk/emotional management)

“Plan Your Trade” template that users can fill in

6. Next Steps

Personalized action plan based on that module (tie into BAE ecosystem)

Button: “Mark as Complete”

Button: “Go to Next Module”

📌 Special Notes per Document
A. Risk_Management_Essentials

Focus on emotional regulation, family-safe investing, capital allocation, and stop-loss logic.

Include "Create Your Risk Plan" form users can complete digitally.

Visuals: Risk pyramid, traffic light investing, stop-loss zones, family-safe crypto checklist.

B. Crypto_Trading_Terminology

Convert glossary into searchable glossary UI with hover definitions.

Use icons and examples to visualize terms (e.g., bulls/bears, candles, whales, FUD).

Add a progress bar to track how many terms have been learned.

C. Candlestick_Patterns_Explained

Include interactive flashcards with “Reveal” behavior for each pattern.

Each pattern should include:

Diagram

What it means

When it appears

How to trade it

Add real chart image samples for practice.

D. Chart_Patterns_for_Beginners

Focus on interactive animations to explain pattern shapes (head & shoulders, triangles, rectangles).

Include “Draw It Yourself” sketch canvas or simulated pattern-building.

Allow toggling between bullish/bearish examples with different chart overlays.

🧬 Tone & Audience Fit

Voice: Supportive, encouraging, and simple — for busy mums entering crypto

Readability: Assume minimal prior technical knowledge

Emotion: Empower through clarity, safety, and practical confidence

🔄 Output Format

Export as individual web modules or structured HTML/React files

Each module should be self-contained but thematically consistent

All assets (images, illustrations, UI blocks) should use the branding visual cues
