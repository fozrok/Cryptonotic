Introduction
Welcome to your comprehensive crypto terminology guide! If you've ever felt lost in a sea
of crypto jargon, you're definitely not alone. The crypto world has its own language, and
as a busy mum stepping into this space, it can feel overwhelming when everyone seems
to be speaking in code.
Think of this guide as your personal translator for the crypto world. Just like learning any
new language, once you understand the basic vocabulary, everything else starts to make
sense. You don't need to memorize every term immediately – this guide is
designed to be your reference companion as you learn and grow in your crypto journey.
Why Understanding Crypto Terms Matters

Basic Cryptocurrency Terms
Cryptocurrency (Crypto)
What it is: A digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography (advanced math) for
security and operates independently of traditional banks.
Why it matters: This is the foundation of everything you'll be trading. Unlike traditional
money controlled by governments, cryptocurrencies are decentralized.
Example: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin are all cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin (BTC)
What it is: The first and most well-known cryptocurrency, created in 2009 by an
anonymous person or group called Satoshi Nakamoto.
Why it matters: Bitcoin is often called "digital gold" and is the most widely accepted
cryptocurrency. Its price movements often influence the entire crypto market.
Example: When people say "crypto is up," they're often referring to Bitcoin's price.
Altcoin
What it is: Any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. "Alt" means alternative.
Why it matters: There are thousands of altcoins, each with different purposes and
potential. Some may offer better opportunities than Bitcoin.
Example: Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana are popular altcoins.


--- PAGE 4 ---

Blockchain
What it is: A digital ledger (like a record book) that stores all cryptocurrency transactions
across many computers. Think of it as a chain of blocks, where each block contains
transaction information.
Why it matters: This technology makes cryptocurrencies secure and transparent. You
can verify any transaction on the blockchain.
Example: When you send Bitcoin to someone, that transaction is recorded permanently
on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Wallet
What it is: A digital tool that allows you to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies. It's
like a bank account for your crypto.
Why it matters: You need a wallet to hold your cryptocurrencies safely. There are
different types with varying levels of security.
Example: MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Ledger are popular wallet options.
Private Key
What it is: A secret code (like a very long password) that gives you access to your
cryptocurrency. It's like the key to your digital safe.
Why it matters: If you lose your private key, you lose access to your crypto forever. If
someone else gets it, they can steal your crypto.
Example: A private key looks like this:
5KJvsngHeMpm884wtkJNzQGaCErckhHJBGFsvd3VyK5qMZXj3hS


--- PAGE 5 ---

Public Key/Address
What it is: An address that others can use to send cryptocurrency to your wallet. It's safe
to share publicly.
Why it matters: This is like your crypto bank account number. You give this to people
who want to send you crypto.
Example: A Bitcoin address looks like this: 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa


--- PAGE 6 ---

Market and Trading Terms
Exchange
What it is: A platform where you can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. It's like a stock
market for crypto.
Why it matters: This is where you'll do most of your crypto trading. Different exchanges
have different features and fees.
Example: Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken are popular crypto exchanges.
Market Cap (Market Capitalization)
What it is: The total value of a cryptocurrency, calculated by multiplying the current price
by the total number of coins in circulation.
Why it matters: Market cap helps you understand how big a cryptocurrency is compared
to others. Larger market caps are generally more stable.
Volume
What it is: The total amount of a cryptocurrency that has been traded within a specific
time period (usually 24 hours).
Why it matters: High volume means lots of people are buying and selling, which usually
makes prices more stable and reliable.
Example: If Bitcoin's 24-hour volume is $30 billion, that's how much Bitcoin was traded in
the last day.

Bull Market
What it is: A period when cryptocurrency prices are rising or expected to rise. Investors
are optimistic and confident.
Why it matters: Bull markets are generally good times to hold crypto, as prices tend to
go up. However, they don't last forever.
Example: "We're in a bull market" means crypto prices are generally rising.
Bear Market
What it is: A period when cryptocurrency prices are falling or expected to fall. Investors
are pessimistic and cautious.
Why it matters: Bear markets can be scary, but they're also opportunities to buy crypto
at lower prices.
Example: "We're in a bear market" means crypto prices are generally falling.
Market Order
What it is: An order to buy or sell cryptocurrency immediately at the current market
price.
Why it matters: This is the fastest way to buy or sell, but you might not get the exact
price you want if the market is moving quickly.
Example: If Bitcoin is $50,000 and you place a market order to buy, you'll get Bitcoin at
whatever the price is when your order executes.
Limit Order
What it is: An order to buy or sell cryptocurrency at a specific price or better.
Why it matters: This gives you more control over the price you pay, but your order
might not execute if the price doesn't reach your target.


--- PAGE 8 ---

Example: You could set a limit order to buy Bitcoin at $48,000, and it will only execute if
Bitcoin drops to that price.
Stop-Loss Order
What it is: An order that automatically sells your cryptocurrency when it reaches a
certain price, designed to limit your losses.
Why it matters: This protects you from major losses if the price drops suddenly while
you're not watching.
Example: If you buy Bitcoin at 120,000, you might set a stop-Loss at 115,000 to limit your
loss to $5,000.
Support Level
What it is: A price level where a cryptocurrency tends to stop falling and may start rising
again.
Why it matters: Support levels can be good places to buy, as the price often bounces up
from these levels.
Example: If Bitcoin has bounced off $45,000 multiple times, that's considered a support
level.
Resistance Level
What it is: A price level where a cryptocurrency tends to stop rising and may start falling
again.
Why it matters: Resistance levels can be good places to sell, as the price often gets
rejected at these levels.
Example: If Bitcoin has been rejected at $55,000 multiple times, that's considered a
resistance level.


--- PAGE 9 ---

Volatility
What it is: How much the price of a cryptocurrency moves up and down over time.
Why it matters: High volatility means bigger potential profits but also bigger potential
losses. Crypto is generally more volatile than traditional investments.


--- PAGE 10 ---

Technical Analysis Terms
Candlestick Chart
What it is: A type of chart that shows the opening, closing, high, and low prices of a
cryptocurrency over a specific time period. Each "candlestick" looks like a candle with
wicks.
Why it matters: Candlestick charts help you understand price movements and market
sentiment. They're essential for technical analysis.
Example: A green candlestick means the price went up during that time period, while a
red one means it went down.
Moving Average
What it is: A line that smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average
price over a specific time period.
Why it matters: Moving averages help you see the overall trend without getting
distracted by short-term price movements.
Example: A 50-day moving average shows the average price over the last 50 days.
RSI (Relative Strength Index)
What it is: A momentum indicator that measures how fast and how much the price is
changing on a scale of 0 to 100.
Why it matters: RSI helps you identify when a cryptocurrency might be overbought (too
expensive) or oversold (too cheap).
Example: An RSI above 70 might mean the price is too high and could fall soon.


--- PAGE 11 ---

MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
What it is: A trend-following indicator that shows the relationship between two moving
averages of a cryptocurrency's price.
Why it matters: MACD helps you spot trend changes and momentum shifts before they
become obvious.
Example: When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it might indicate a good
time to buy.
Trend
What it is: The general direction that a cryptocurrency's price is moving over time.
Why it matters: "The trend is your friend" – it's usually easier to make money by trading
in the direction of the trend.
Example: If Bitcoin has been generally rising for weeks, that's an uptrend.
Breakout
What it is: When the price moves above a resistance level or below a support level with
strong momentum.
Why it matters: Breakouts often signal the start of significant price movements and can
be good trading opportunities.
Consolidation
What it is: A period when the price moves sideways within a narrow range, neither
trending up nor down.
Why it matters: Consolidation often happens before big price movements. It's like the
market is taking a break before deciding which direction to go.


--- PAGE 12 ---

Pump and Dump
What it is: A scheme where people artificially inflate (pump) the price of a cryptocurrency
and then sell (dump) it quickly for profit.
Why it matters: These are scams that can cause you to lose money. Be wary of coins that
suddenly spike in price with lots of hype.
Example: A little-known coin suddenly jumps 500% with lots of social media promotion,
then crashes the next day.
Security and Wallet Terms
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
What it is: An extra layer of security that requires two different methods to access your
account (like a password plus a code from your phone).
Why it matters: 2FA significantly reduces the risk of someone hacking your crypto
accounts. Always enable it on exchanges and wallets.
Example: After entering your password, you also need to enter a 6-digit code from an
app like Google Authenticator.
Cold Storage
What it is: Storing cryptocurrency offline, typically on a hardware wallet that's not
connected to the internet.
Why it matters: Cold storage is the most secure way to store large amounts of crypto
because hackers can't access offline devices.
Example: A Ledger or Trezor hardware wallet that you keep in a safe.


--- PAGE 13 ---

Hot Wallet
What it is: A cryptocurrency wallet that's connected to the internet, making it convenient
but potentially less secure than cold storage.
Why it matters: Hot wallets are good for small amounts you want to trade frequently,
but not for long-term storage of large amounts.
Example: The Coinbase app on your phone or MetaMask browser extension.
Seed Phrase (Recovery Phrase)
What it is: A list of 12-24 words that can restore access to your cryptocurrency wallet if
you lose your device.
Why it matters: This is your backup key to your crypto. Write it down and store it safely –
never share it with anyone or store it digitally.
Example: "apple banana cherry dog elephant..." (12-24 words that restore your wallet).
Phishing
What it is: A scam where criminals create fake websites or emails that look legitimate to
steal your login information or private keys.
Why it matters: Phishing is one of the most common ways people lose their crypto.
Always double-check URLs and be suspicious of unexpected emails.
Example: A fake email claiming to be from Coinbase asking you to "verify" your account
by entering your password.


--- PAGE 14 ---

Common Crypto Slang
HODL
What it is: Originally a misspelling of "hold," now means to keep your cryptocurrency for
a long time instead of selling it, regardless of price fluctuations.
Why it matters: HODLing is a popular strategy for people who believe in long-term
crypto growth rather than short-term trading.
Example: "I'm going to HODL my Bitcoin for the next five years."
FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)
What it is: The anxiety that you might miss out on a profitable investment opportunity,
often leading to impulsive buying decisions.
Why it matters: FOMO can cause you to make emotional decisions and buy at high
prices. It's important to stick to your plan.
Example: Buying a cryptocurrency just because it's going up rapidly, without doing
research.
FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt)
What it is: Negative information or sentiment spread to create fear and uncertainty
about a particular cryptocurrency.
Why it matters: FUD can cause unnecessary panic selling. Learn to distinguish between
legitimate concerns and baseless fear-mongering.
Example: Spreading rumors that "Bitcoin will be banned" without any real evidence.

Diamond Hands
What it is: Refers to someone who holds onto their cryptocurrency investments despite
significant price volatility or pressure to sell.
Why it matters: Having "diamond hands" means you stick to your long-term strategy
even when prices are falling.
Example: Keeping your Bitcoin even when it drops 50% because you believe in its long-
term potential.
Paper Hands
What it is: Refers to someone who sells their cryptocurrency quickly when prices start to
fall, often at a loss.
Why it matters: "Paper hands" often sell at the worst times due to fear, missing out on
potential recoveries.
Example: Selling all your crypto the moment prices start dropping.
To the Moon
What it is: An expression meaning that a cryptocurrency's price will rise dramatically.
Why it matters: While optimism is good, be wary of unrealistic expectations. Not every
coin will go "to the moon."
Example: "Bitcoin is going to the moon!" means someone thinks Bitcoin's price will rise
significantly.


--- PAGE 16 ---

Whale
What it is: An individual or entity that owns a large amount of cryptocurrency, enough to
potentially influence market prices.
Why it matters: Whale movements can cause significant price changes. Some traders
watch whale activity for trading signals.
Example: Someone who owns 1,000+ Bitcoin would be considered a whale.
Bag
What it is: A large quantity of a specific cryptocurrency that someone owns, especially if
it's not performing well.
Why it matters: Being a "bagholder" means you're stuck with a cryptocurrency that's
losing value.
Example: "I'm holding a heavy bag of XYZ coin" means you own a lot of XYZ coin that's
not doing well.
DeFi and Advanced Terms (Simplified)
DeFi (Decentralized Finance)
What it is: Financial services built on blockchain technology
